# Face Recognition
This is a human face recognition project.

## The current assumptions and prerequisites are as follows:
1. Use the self-encoder to extract the main features of the face.
2. Calculate the distance of the encoded feature using the distance algorithm.
3. The sample we envision is a sample of the entire image that is a face. The data set we just used is such a sample.
4. When applied to the actual situation, we also need to use other algorithms to crop the face from the natural image.

## DataSet
The dataset is CASIA-WebFace. It's very large, so you need to download it separately.

### 1. How to download the DataSet?
[Download it](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Of_EVz-yHV7QVWQGihYfvtny9Ne8qXVz)

**NOTE**: It requires a stable international internet connetction.
